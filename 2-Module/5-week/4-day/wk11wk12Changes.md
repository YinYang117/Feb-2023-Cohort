# Updated Week 11 and 12 Plan

## Homework for Saturday

If we look at AA Open, we'll see that there are readings for the upcoming
sorting algorithms that we'll be covering. We're going to shift those readings
to be homework for Saturday, and spend Saturday working as pairs on all of the
practices for Monday, and possibly Tuesday depending on how we do as a class.
Note that there are two additional readings at the bottom of the following list
that come from Homework for Tuesday of next week.

## Class Work on Saturday

We'll be following [Monday's Outline](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-feb-2023-online/week-12---sorts-and-graphs/bubble-sort-practice)
for class on Saturday. We'll take some extra time to ensure that everyone has a 
chance to solve these algorithms on their own, before coming back together and 
walking through each one. We'll likely get into some of [Tuesday's content](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/js-py---pt-feb-2023-online/week-12---sorts-and-graphs/merge-sort-practice)
as well, however we'll see how things go.

## Homework for Monday

To make better use of our class time together next week, we'll be starting the 
graphs content much earlier than otherwise intended. If sorting goes well on 
Saturday, we'll dive right into graphs on Monday. However if we need Monday to
continue to hone our sorting skills, we'll make that time available. To prepare
for graphs on Monday, please make sure to complete the Homework for Wednesday
section prior to Monday. This homework is all about graphs, and how we can
translate concepts from Trees into graphs.

The earlier we can expose ourselves to material related to graphs, the more 
prepared we can be for the coming week. Graphs tend to be a pain pooint for many
learners as they progress through the material, and I'm hopeful that we can 
better utilize the upcoming week by seeing it as early as Monday or Tuesday 
rather than Wednesday as initially designed. 

The coding portions of the assessment will feature Graphs and Trees, and 
understanding these data structures will be instrumental in our success.
