# Linked Lists

What is a linked list? Linked Lists operate similarly to arrays. They have sequential order, they store elements in the form of value, and they are a data structure. In Javascript, these linked lists are represented with objects.

As we saw last week, arrays are really good at adding and removing from the back (acting like a stack), whereas Linked Lists will be really good at adding and removing from the front (acting like a queue)

Linked Lists are made of Nodes. Each node will point to the next variable, or null.

Here is a basic structure of a linked list.

A -> B -> C -> null


A, B, C are nodes. Each node has a 'next' key that points to the following node. We can think of the arrows as the 'next' key. Eventually our list has to end, and we represent that with null.
