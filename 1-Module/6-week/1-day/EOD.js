/*

Create a function that will take in a word.
It will seemingly animate the word to make it look like it is sliding
to the right and then disappearing one character at a time.


If the word is 20+ characters, just have it disappear to the right.


If it is less, we need to slowly move it to the hidden curtain existing at length 20




TIPS:
- Use recursion to easily control the message queue
- Use console.clear() to clean up the terminal as needed
- Use around 100-200 ms per stack to make a smooth transition
- Use String.endsWith() to check when the word is fully gone
